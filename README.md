## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I learned how to code in college, and then took a major career detour in the military. I haven't done any coding in a few years, but excited to get back into it!

Now I work at Palantir and lead our new startups business.

I'm working on some side projects to build up my skills, splitting time between here and building in AIP / Foundry.
